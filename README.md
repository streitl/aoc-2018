# Solutions to the 2018 edition of the Advent of Code

If you want to get the answer of the day x puzzle for your input, just copy it in the file inputx.txt and run ./dayx.py

For day 19, I had to analyse the input "by hand" so my answer is not generic. Have a look at the file program19.txt if you are looking for some help.

The day 23 solution is *heavily* inspired from this one : https://gist.github.com/pdewacht/fa7aa7e60952c6d67956599d6d4af360

If you have any suggestions I'm always listening :1
